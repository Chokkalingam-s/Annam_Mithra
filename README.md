### 🍛 AnnamMitra — Vanish Hunger, Share Surplus

<small>

#### 🌍 Hyperlocal Food Redistribution Platform

**AnnamMitra** is a **hyperlocal community-driven food redistribution app** that bridges the gap between surplus food providers (Donors) and those in need (Receivers).  
Built for empathy and impact, AnnamMitra ensures **zero food waste**, **real-time sharing**, and **human connection** through a beautiful, intuitive mobile experience.

#### 💡 Problem Statement

Every day, edible food goes to waste in households, restaurants, and events — while millions sleep hungry nearby.  
The lack of a **real-time, hyperlocal system** to connect donors and receivers leads to inefficiency and missed opportunities to help.

AnnamMitra eliminates this gap through **map-based matching, instant notifications, and volunteer-powered delivery** — making food reach those who need it most, on time.

#### 🎯 Core Idea

> “Share Food. Vanish Hunger. Build Humanity.”

A single app where:
- Families, restaurants, and cloud kitchens can **donate surplus food**.
- Individuals or NGOs can **receive food in real-time**.
- Volunteers can **bridge the gap** as delivery partners or **tag hunger hotspots** on the map.
